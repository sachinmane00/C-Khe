  1. Overview
  C-Khe ("the App") is a CBSE Class 10 learning app developed for students. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data the   
  App does and does not collect.

  2. Data We Do NOT Collect
  C-Khe does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. The App does not require account creation, login, or registration of any
   kind. We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, location, or any other personal data.

  3. Data Stored Locally on Your Device
  The App stores the following data exclusively on your device using Android's local storage (AsyncStorage). This data never leaves your device:
  - Your XP points and level
  - Your daily study streak count
  - Bookmarked cards
  - Recently searched topics
  - Onboarding selections (board and class)

  This data is deleted when you uninstall the App.

  4. AI Search Feature
  When you use the in-app search, your search query text is sent to Google's Gemini API to generate learning cards. No personal information is attached to    
  this request. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for how Google processes API requests: https://policies.google.com/privacy

  5. Children's Privacy
  C-Khe is designed for students including those under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children or any other users.  
  The App is fully functional without any personal data.

  6. Third-Party Services
