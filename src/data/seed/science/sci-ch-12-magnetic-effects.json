        "title": "Properties of Magnetic Field Lines",
        "body": "A magnetic field is the region around a magnet where its force can be detected.\n\n**Key Properties:**\n1. They emerge from the North pole and merge at the South pole (outside the magnet).\n2. Inside the magnet, the direction is from South to North.\n3. They are closed curves.\n4. The degree of closeness represents the strength of the field.\n5. **Two field lines never intersect** (at the point of intersection, a compass would show two directions, which is impossible).",
        "analogy": "Think of field lines like invisible 'lanes' of force. The closer the lanes, the more 'crowded' and strong the force is."

        "exactPhrase": "Short-circuiting occurs when the live wire and neutral wire come into direct contact (due to damaged insulation), causing current to rise abruptly. Overloading occurs when too many high-power appliances are connected to a single socket or the supply voltage increases accidentally."
