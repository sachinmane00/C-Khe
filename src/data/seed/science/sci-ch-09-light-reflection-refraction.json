        "title": "What is Light?",
        "body": "Light is a form of energy that enables us to see objects. It travels in straight lines (Rectilinear propagation). \n\n**Reflection:** Bouncing back of light when it strikes a polished surface.\n**Refraction:** Bending of light when it travels from one medium to another.",
        "analogy": "Reflection is like a ball bouncing off a wall. Refraction is like a car slowing down and turning slightly when it hits a patch of sand on the road."

It always forms a virtual, erect, and diminished image.\n\n**Principal Focus (F):** The point where rays parallel to the axis meet (concave) or appear to diverge from (convex)."
