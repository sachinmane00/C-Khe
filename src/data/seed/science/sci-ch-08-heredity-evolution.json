        "body": "**Heredity:** The transmission of characters (traits) from parents to offspring.\n**Variation:** The differences among the individuals of a species. \n\nSexual reproduction leads to greater variation because it involves the combination of DNA from two different individuals. This variation is the basis for the survival of species in changing environments.",

In the F2 generation, new combinations (Round-Green and Wrinkled-Yellow) appeared alongside parental types.\n\n**F2 Phenotypic Ratio:** 9 : 3 : 3 : 1"

If the gene for tallness works efficiently, a lot of plant growth hormone is produced, making the plant tall. If the gene has an alteration, less protein/hormone is made, and the plant remains short."

        "exactPhrase": "In humans, the sex of the child is determined by the father. This is because mothers only produce eggs with X chromosomes, while fathers produce two types of sperms—50% with X and 50% with Y. Therefore, the gender depends purely on which sperm fertilizes the egg."
