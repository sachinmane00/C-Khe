        "title": "DNA Copying and Variation",
        "body": "Reproduction involves creating a copy of the DNA (the blueprint of body design). No biochemical reaction is 100% accurate; therefore, DNA copying always results in some variations.\n\n**Significance:** Variation is useful for the survival of species over time, especially when environmental conditions change drastically (e.g., global warming or antibiotic resistance).",
        "analogy": "Like photocopying a drawing. If you copy the copy repeatedly, tiny errors (variations) creep in. Some errors might make the drawing look better or more interesting!"

Regeneration is carried out by specialized cells and is the ability of an organism to regrow lost parts or whole individuals from accidental cuts (e.g., Planaria)."
