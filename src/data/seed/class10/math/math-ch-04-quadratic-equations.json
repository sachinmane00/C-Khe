        "body": "A quadratic equation in the variable $x$ is an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a, b, c$ are real numbers and **$a \neq 0$**.\n\n- The degree of the equation is always 2.\n- The values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are called the **roots** (or zeroes) of the equation.",
        "analogy": "It's like a scale. To keep the 'Quadratic' identity, the $x^2$ term must always be there. If $a$ becomes zero, the $x^2$ disappears, and it turns into a boring linear equation."
