        "body": "The basic functions performed by living organisms to maintain their life on earth are called life processes. \n\n**Core Processes:**\n1. Nutrition (Obtaining energy)\n2. Respiration (Releasing energy)\n3. Transportation (Moving materials)\n4. Excretion (Removing waste)\n\n**Note:** Even when we are asleep or sitting still, these maintenance processes must continue to prevent damage and breakdown.",
        "analogy": "Like a car engine that needs fuel (nutrition), oxygen (respiration), a cooling system (transportation), and an exhaust pipe (excretion) to keep running smoothly."

Receives Bile (from liver) to emulsify fats and Pancreatic juice (Trypsin/Lipase) to break proteins/fats.\n- **Villi:** Finger-like projections that increase surface area for absorption."

Gives $CO_2$ + $H_2O$ + **Lots of Energy**.\n2. **Anaerobic (in Yeast):** Absence of $O_2$. Gives Ethanol + $CO_2$ + Low Energy.\n3. **Lack of $O_2$ (in Muscle Cells):** Gives **Lactic Acid** + Low Energy (causes cramps)."

        "exactPhrase": "Alveoli are tiny balloon-like structures that provide a very large surface area for the exchange of gases. Their walls are extremely thin and contain an extensive network of blood vessels to facilitate rapid diffusion of $O_2$ and $CO_2$."
