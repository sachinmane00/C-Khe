        "body": "A chemical reaction is a process where substances (reactants) undergo internal changes to form new substances (products) with entirely different properties. \n\n**Common Indicators:**\n1. Change in State (e.g., burning wax)\n2. Change in Colour (e.g., rusting of iron)\n3. Evolution of a Gas (e.g., zinc + acid → hydrogen gas)\n4. Change in Temperature (e.g., quicklime + water)\n5. Formation of a Precipitate (an insoluble solid)",
        "analogy": "Think of it like LEGOs. You take apart a tower (reactants) and use the exact same bricks to build a car (products). The identity of the bricks stays the same, but the structure is brand new!"

        "title": "Why and How we Balance Equations",
        "body": "We balance equations because of the **Law of Conservation of Mass**: Mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. \n\n**Steps to Balance (Hit & Trial Method):**\n1. Write the word equation.\n2. Convert to chemical symbols.\n3. Count atoms of each element on LHS and RHS.\n4. Start balancing the element with the maximum atoms (usually Oxygen or Hydrogen).\n5. Use coefficients (numbers in front) — **NEVER** change the subscripts in a formula!",
        "analogy": "Think of a balance scale. If you have 4 'H' atoms on the left, you MUST have 4 'H' atoms on the right, otherwise, the universe's accounting doesn't add up."

        "correctIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "The Law of Conservation of Mass states that the total mass of reactants must equal the total mass of products. Therefore, the number of atoms of each element must remain constant. Physical states (s, l, g, aq) are helpful but not the reason for balancing."
