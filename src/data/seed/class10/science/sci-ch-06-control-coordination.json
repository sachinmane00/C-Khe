        "body": "The neuron (nerve cell) is the functional unit of the nervous system.\n- **Dendrites:** Receive information.\n- **Cell Body (Cyton):** Processes the signal.\n- **Axon:** Transmits electrical impulse away from the cell body.\n- **Nerve Ending:** Releases chemicals to cross the gap to the next neuron.\n\n**Synapse:** The functional gap between two neurons where electrical signals are converted into chemical signals (neurotransmitters).",
        "analogy": "A neuron is like a relay race runner. The dendrites catch the baton (signal), the axon is the runner sprinting, and the synapse is the hand-off to the next runner."

The sequence is: Stimulus → Receptor (Sense organ) → Sensory Neuron → Spinal Cord (Relay Neuron) → Motor Neuron → Effector (Muscle/Gland) → Response.
